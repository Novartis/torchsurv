    "In this notebook, we analyse a simulated dataset with time-varying covariates and survival outcomes. `TorchSurv` is used to train a model that predicts relative risk of subjects based on covariates observed over time. We will attempt to thoroughly explain the necessary elements to understand our implementation, but for a detailed read on time-varying survival models refer to Chapter 6 of [Dynamic Regression Models for Survival Data](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-33960-4). \n",

    "To run this notebook, dependencies must be installed. the recommended method is to use our developpment conda environment (**preffered**). Instruction can be found [here](https://opensource.nibr.com/torchsurv/devnotes.html#set-up-a-development-environment-via-conda) to install all optional dependancies.

    "Let $i$ e the index for some subject $i$ with a failute time denoted as $\\tau^*_i$ and $C$ be the censoring time. For the moment $C$ remains constant but there are extensions that allow for $C$ to vary over $i$. Let $\\tau_i = min(\\tau^*_i, C)$. We use $\\delta_i$ to denote whether $\\tau^*_i$ was observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use $Z(t)$ to denote the value of of covariate $Z$ and time $t$. \n",
    "We use $Z(t)$ to denote the value of Z at time $t$ and $\\overline{Z}(t)$ to denote the set of covariates from the beggining up to time $t$: $ \\overline{Z}(t) = \\{ Z(s): 0 \\leq s \\leq t\\}$.\n",
    "Let $t_k$ for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, K\\} denote the time points at which the covariates are observed. For the moment, we assume that all subjects have been observed on the same time grid. $R_k$ is the set of individuals who are at risk at $t_k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional hazard function of $T$ given $\\overline{Z}(t)$ is defined as\n",
    "$$ \\lambda(T|\\overline{Z}(t)) = Pr(T \\in [t, t+ dt)|T \\geq t, \\overline{Z}(t)), $$\n",
    "in other words, it is the probability that an event will occur in the next time instance if we have observed covariates up to time $t$ and that a subject has not yet experienced an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical cox proportional hazards model with constant covariates $Z$ assumes a constant hazard ratio: $\\lambda(T|Z)= \\lambda_0(t) exp(\\beta Z)$, where $\\beta$ in an unknown set of regression parameters and $\\lambda_0(t)$ is an unspecified baseline hazard function. In this case $\\frac{\\lambda(T|Z)}{\\lambda_0(t)} = exp(\\beta Z) $. The cumlative hazard ia defined as $\\Lambda(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda(s)ds$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a time varying cox model, the hazard ratio is now dependant on time:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\lambda(t|Z)}{\\lambda_0(t)} = exp(\\beta Z(t)) $$ \n",

    "$$ \\lambda(t|Z) = \\lambda_0(t)exp(\\beta Z(t)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $i_j$ denote the label or identity of the individual who fails at time $\\tau_j$, including the value of their time-varying covariate\n",

    "\n",
    "Taking the log on both sides, we get the partial log-likelihood:\n",
    "$$ \\log L (\\beta) = \\sum_j \\Big (\\beta Z_i(\\tau_j)) - \\log [\\sum_{j \\in R_i} \\exp(\\beta Z_i(\\tau_j))]\\Big ). $$\n",

    "### Extension to neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a more genera form, where we have the cox proportional hazards model:\n",
    "$$\\lambda(T|\\overline{Z}(t))= \\lambda_0(t) \\theta(Z(t))$$\n",
