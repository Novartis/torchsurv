We will attempt to thoroughly explain the necessary elements to understand our implementation, but for a detailed read on time-varying survival models refer to Chapter 6 of [Dynamic Regression Models for Survival Data](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-33960-4). For a more brief explanation, please refer to these [slides](https://ms.uky.edu/~mai/sta635/Cox%20model.pdf). Below is a summary of the necessary information."

    "Future projects can take on various themes: testing edge cases of this implementation, improving the code to become more robust to different data types, include weibull distribution and compare this approate.\n",
    "Testing edge cases:\n",
    "- use the simulated data and change different parameters to see how it affects performance, this can help guide appropriate use\n",
    "- design slightly different simulations known for being difficult or easy in specific scenarios\n",
    "- use a dataset with known properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving code to be more robust:\n",
    "- generalising the loss functions and overall defining the formatting required or it to work, generalise for different time scales etc.\n",
    "- extend the method to deal with multiple types of covariates in one loss function or a combination of multiple losses. This can extend to multiple time-varyin covariates and mixing time-invarint and varying ones.\n",

    "Weibull:\n",
    "- Extent the cox loss function to also include the Weibull distribution, this is described for both the log-likelihood and the simulation\n",
